research
========

In a nutshell, there is no code without a problem to be solved. If there is no problem, there is no code. External stakeholders formulate problems that are broken down into top-level issues (Research). All other issues - hence all code addressing these issues - reference top-level issues. There are only three stakeholders: clients (commission software), users (consume), and peers (collaborate). Each top-level issue references stakeholders via tags: client, user, peer. The gist of it: Anyone at anytime sees any code solving someone's problem - Life has a purpose.
